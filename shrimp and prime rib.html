             <p> Heat the grill on high. Heat the oven to 350 F. In a large bowl, mix together the paprika, celery seeds, cayenne and garlic powder. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until needed.Season both sides of the ribs with salt and pepper, then spritz the ribs and onion rounds with cooking spray. Place the ribs and onions on the grill and sear for 10 minutes per side. Transfer the onions and ribs (onions on the bottom) to a roasting pan. Add the beer and 2 cups of the chicken broth. Cover with foil and bake for about 2 1/2 hours, or until the meat is very tender. About 30 minutes before the ribs are done, in a medium saucepan combine the rice, remaining 2 cups of chicken broth and saffron. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce to simmer and cook for 20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed. When the ribs are finished, transfer them to a plate and cover with foil. Set a mesh strainer over a bowl and pour the cooking liquid from the roasting pan through; discard any solids. Skim off and discard any fat from the strained liquid. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the shrimp, asparagus, garlic and shallot, then saute for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the shrimp and asparagus to a plate, then return the skillet to the burner. Use the strained cooking liquid to deglaze the skillet, scraping the bottom to release any charred bits. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced and thickened, about 4 minutes.Serve the ribs with the rice and shrimp and asparagus. Drizzle with the pan sauce.</p>
